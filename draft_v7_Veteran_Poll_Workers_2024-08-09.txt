TV1 Local Military Veterans Recruited for Election Jobs in Maricopa County 
 PHOENIX (AP) — Election officials in Maricopa County, Arizona, announced a program designed to recruit military veterans and their family members from the community to serve as election administrators, including election polling place workers, temporary workers, and full-time staff. As the U.S. general elections in November near, election officials must fill several thousand temporary positions and hundreds of other open positions to ensure sufficient staffing for the 2024 elections and beyond. 
 
Army veteran Jordan Braxton just joined the elections workforce. Jordan believes their role is important to ensuring a secure, accurate, and transparent election, “Many places are short on staff this election cycle. I served my country in the Army, and I want to do my part as a veteran and a citizen to ensure that everyone trusts the process and the outcome of the election.”

Q21 Thank you for completing this survey! 
 During this survey you might have read stories about on-going recruitment of election staff or poll workers from veteran U.S. service members or from the general public. These stories were modeled after actual news stories but were not real. We apologize for this. We created them in order to better understand how the news about elections influences people’s opinions about politics.
 
 Please do not, therefore, base your own evaluations of policies, public officials, political parties, poll workers, election staff, or veteran U.S. service members on the material you read in this study. Researching election worker volunteer shortages on your own via various information sources is the best way to understand how elections are administrated in the United States and any current issues. These are all the questions we have for you.
 
 Thank you for your time and should you have questions, please contact: Professor Michael Hanmer, 3140 Tydings Hall, College Park Maryland 20910 Tel. 301-405-7379 or email: mhanmer@umd.edu.
