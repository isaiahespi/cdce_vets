The five statements were prefaced with the question, \"How likely do you think any or all of the following will happen during this yearÂ´s elections in Maricopa County, AZ?\"\n\n1.    There will be voter fraud, that is, people who are not eligible to vote will vote, or vote more than once;\n2.    Many votes will not actually be counted\n3.    Many people will show up to vote and be told they are not eligible\n4.    A foreign country will tamper with the votes cast in this area to change the results\n5.

Survey participants responded to six statements, all prefaced with the following,\n\n> \"Regardless of whether any of these are actually the case, how would the following impact your confidence in the fairness and accuracy of elections conducted this November?\"\n\n1.    Election officials test every machine used in the election to ensure they are secure.\n2.    Election officials conduct audits of ballots after every election to confirm the results were accurate.\n3.    Poll watchers affiliated with the political parties or candidates observe the election.\n4.    Election staff and volunteers include military veterans and their family members from the community[^1].\n5.    Election staff and volunteers include lawyers from the community.\n6.    Election staff and volunteers include college students from the community.\n\nFor each statement, survey participants responded by selecting one of five response options:\n\n1.    Decrease confidence a lot\n2.    Decrease confidence somewhat\n3.    No impact on confidence\n4.    Increase confidence somewhat\n5.    Increase confidence a lot\n\n\nThe primary interest concerned whether confidence in election fairness would increase or decreased based on the composition of election staff and volunteers. Of particular importance are responses to the statement which asked respondents to consider whether inclusion of military veterans and veteran's family members as election staff and volunteers has any impact on their confidence in the fairness and accuracy of elections in November. In this case, significant differences were observed between treatment and control groups. \n\nThe figure below displays a clear boost in confidence when election staff includes veterans and family members, but most especially for those who were in the treatment group. That is, the percentage of people who said their confidence in election fairness would increase when election staff includes veterans was about 11.6 percentage points higher than those who said the same in the control group.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Fig Q41\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-column-page-inset-right}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-q41-1.pdf){#fig-q41}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Q41 Coef Plot\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-column-page-inset-right}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-q41-coef-plot-1.pdf){#fig-q41-coef-plot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\nAn 11.6 percentage point difference was observed between treatment and control groups among those who reported that their confidence in the fairness and accuracy of elections would \"increase a lot\" or \"increase somewhat\" when election staff and volunteers include (or consist of a majority of) military service veterans and their family members in the community. This difference was estimated with 95% confidence to be statistically significant (p < 0.01, CI [-0.169, -0.057]).  Conversely, no difference was observed between treatment and control groups among those who reported that their confidence would \"decrease a lot\" or \"decrease somewhat\".\n\n\n[^1]: Two different versions of this statement was presented to survey participants. Half of the sample read the statement as, \"Election staff and volunteers *include* military veterans and their family members from the community\", whereas the other half of the sample read, \"The *majority* of election staff and volunteers consist of military veterans and their family members from the community.\" No significant differences in responses were observed between those who read one version of the statement over the other. However, the same was done for statements number 5 and 6 which concern \"lawyers from the community\" and \"college students from the community\". Significant differences were found when comparing responses between the different versions of these statements. See the appendix for further discussion on these results.  \n\n\nIn the following table, responses were collapsed into three categories. Any increase in confidence (e.g., increase confidence a lot, increase confidence somewhat) were collapsed into one column, and likewise for any response indicating a decrease in confidence.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-4 .cell .column-body-outset-right tbl-cap='Confidence Impact on Election Fairness and Accuracy'}\n\\begingroup\\fontsize{13}{15}\\selectfont\n\n\\begin{tabu} to \\linewidth {>{\\raggedright}X>{\\raggedright}X>{\\raggedright}X>{\\raggedright}X>{\\raggedright}X}\n\\hline\nCondition/Election staff include veterans and family & Decrease Confidence & No Impact & Increase Confidence & Total\\\\\n\\hline\nControl & 10.11\\%  (63) & 44.78\\% (279) & 45.10\\% (281) & 100.00\\%   (623)\\\\\n\\hline\nTreatment & 8.62\\%  (55) & 34.64\\% (221) & 56.74\\% (362) & 100.00\\%   (638)\\\\\n\\hline\nTotal & 9.36\\% (118) & 39.65\\% (500) & 50.99\\% (643) & 100.00\\% (1,261)\\\\\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{5}{l}{\\rule{0pt}{1em}\\textit{Note: }}\\\\\n\\multicolumn{5}{l}{\\rule{0pt}{1em}NA omitted. \\% (n)}\\\\\n\\end{tabu}\n\\endgroup{}\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results suggest that reading a vignette about county efforts to recruit veterans as election staff and volunteers does more to increase one's confidence in the fairness and accuracy of elections, especially under the prospect that election staff and volunteers would include veterans and their family members.\n\n### Impact on Confidence in Voter Safety at polling sites\n\n\nThe same analysis was conducted for questions that assessed the reported impact on confidence that voters would be safe to vote in-person. Survey participants provided responses to the same six statements as before, which were all prefaced with the following question,\n\n> \"How would the following impact your confidence that voters are safe from violence, threats of violence, or intimidation while voting in-person during elections this November?\"\n\nAgain, the bar graph below displays a clear boost among participants in the treatment group who reported that their confidence in voter safety would increase when election staff is said to include veterans and their family members. \n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Fig Q43\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-column-page-inset-right}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-q43-1.pdf){#fig-q43}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Q43 Coef Plot\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-column-page-inset-right}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-q43-coefplot-1.pdf){#fig-q43-coefplot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\nThe proportion of people who said their confidence in voter safety would increase when election staff includes veterans was about 8.4 percentage points higher than those who said the same in the control group.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-7 .cell tbl-cap='Confidence Impact on In-person Voter Safety'}\n\\begingroup\\fontsize{13}{15}\\selectfont\n\n\\begin{tabu} to \\linewidth {>{\\raggedright}X>{\\raggedright}X>{\\raggedright}X>{\\raggedright}X>{\\raggedright}X}\n\\hline\nCondition/Election staff include veterans and family & Decrease Confidence & No Impact & Increase Confidence & Total\\\\\n\\hline\nControl & 12.20\\%  (76) & 38.68\\% (241) & 49.12\\% (306) & 100.00\\%   (623)\\\\\n\\hline\nTreatment & 9.09\\%  (58) & 33.39\\% (213) & 57.52\\% (367) & 100.00\\%   (638)\\\\\n\\hline\nTotal & 10.63\\% (134) & 36.00\\% (454) & 53.37\\% (673) & 100.00\\% (1,261)\\\\\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{5}{l}{\\rule{0pt}{1em}\\textit{Note: }}\\\\\n\\multicolumn{5}{l}{\\rule{0pt}{1em}NA omitted. \\% (n)}\\\\\n\\end{tabu}\n\\endgroup{}\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n# Sample Demographics and Balance\n\nThe decision was made to exclude any respondents who didn't complete the survey. There were a total of 125 respondents who started but didn't finish the survey. Of those 125, 105 quit before reaching `Q40_1`, whereas the rest exited the survey after that question[^2].\n\n[^2]: Due to the programming of the survey, respondents were randomly assigned to either question set 'A' or question set 'B'. The grouping variable in the data set is `Qset`. Those respondents assigned to `Qset A` answered questions `Q41` and `Q43`; those assigned to `Qset B` answered question `Q44` and `Q46`. For each question, respondents were presented six statements and selected a response on a 5-point scale from \"Decrease Confidence a lot\" to \"Increase confidence a lot\". The six statements were the same for each question. This resulted in six variables per question within the data set (e.g., Q41_1 to Q41_6), where each variable consisted of responses to one of the six particular statements. Tests of differences in proportion between the question sets determined that responses were mostly equivalent between question sets (i.e., no statistically significant differences between proportions) except for the fifth and sixth statements pertaining to lawyers and college students. More detailed information on the results of this analysis are given in a supplementary document. \n\n `NA` missing values from the `Qset` variable removes those 105 partial survey responses, i.e., respondents who quit prior to reaching `Q40`.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-demog .cell .column-page tbl-cap='Survey sample characteristics by treatment condition'}\n\\begingroup\\fontsize{13}{15}\\selectfont\n\n\\begin{tabu} to \\linewidth {>{\\raggedright}X>{\\raggedright}X>{\\raggedright}X>{\\raggedright}X}\n\\toprule\nÂ  & Control & Treatment & Overall\\\\\n\\midrule\n & (N=624) & (N=639) & (N=1263)\\\\\n\\addlinespace[0.3em]\n\\multicolumn{4}{l}{\\textbf{Age categorized into eight groups}}\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}18-24 & 56 (9.0\\%) & 51 (8.0\\%) & 107 (8.5\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}25-34 & 107 (17.1\\%) & 127 (19.9\\%) & 234 (18.5\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}35-44 & 130 (20.8\\%) & 121 (18.9\\%) & 251 (19.9\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}45-54 & 113 (18.1\\%) & 110 (17.2\\%) & 223 (17.7\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}55-64 & 124 (19.9\\%) & 115 (18.0\\%) & 239 (18.9\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}65-74 & 70 (11.2\\%) & 74 (11.6\\%) & 144 (11.4\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}75-84 & 20 (3.2\\%) & 36 (5.6\\%) & 56 (4.4\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}85-92 & 4 (0.6\\%) & 5 (0.8\\%) & 9 (0.7\\%)\\\\\n\\addlinespace[0.3em]\n\\multicolumn{4}{l}{\\textbf{What is your current gender?}}\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Male & 285 (45.7\\%) & 307 (48.0\\%) & 592 (46.9\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Female & 329 (52.7\\%) & 326 (51.0\\%) & 655 (51.9\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Other/Refused & 10 (1.6\\%) & 6 (0.9\\%) & 16 (1.3\\%)\\\\\n\\addlinespace[0.3em]\n\\multicolumn{4}{l}{\\textbf{Primary race reported by respondent}}\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}White or Caucasian & 476 (76.3\\%) & 493 (77.2\\%) & 969 (76.7\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Black or African American & 82 (13.1\\%) & 79 (12.4\\%) & 161 (12.7\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}American Indian & 10 (1.6\\%) & 12 (1.9\\%) & 22 (1.7\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Asian & 26 (4.2\\%) & 30 (4.7\\%) & 56 (4.4\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Other & 30 (4.8\\%) & 25 (3.9\\%) & 55 (4.4\\%)\\\\\n\\addlinespace[0.3em]\n\\multicolumn{4}{l}{\\textbf{Highest level of education completed}}\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Less than high school degree & 20 (3.2\\%) & 14 (2.2\\%) & 34 (2.7\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}High school graduate (high school diploma or equivalent including GED) & 152 (24.4\\%) & 174 (27.2\\%) & 326 (25.8\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Some college but no degree & 141 (22.6\\%) & 140 (21.9\\%) & 281 (22.2\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Associate degree in college (2-year) & 69 (11.1\\%) & 68 (10.6\\%) & 137 (10.8\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Bachelor's degree in college (4-year) & 166 (26.6\\%) & 156 (24.4\\%) & 322 (25.5\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Master's degree & 61 (9.8\\%) & 69 (10.8\\%) & 130 (10.3\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Doctoral degree & 5 (0.8\\%) & 13 (2.0\\%) & 18 (1.4\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Professional degree (JD, MD) & 10 (1.6\\%) & 5 (0.8\\%) & 15 (1.2\\%)\\\\\n\\addlinespace[0.3em]\n\\multicolumn{4}{l}{\\textbf{Party ID 3 categories, with true Independents}}\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Republican & 261 (41.8\\%) & 276 (43.2\\%) & 537 (42.5\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Democrat & 282 (45.2\\%) & 283 (44.3\\%) & 565 (44.7\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Independent & 81 (13.0\\%) & 79 (12.4\\%) & 160 (12.7\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Missing & 0 (0\\%) & 1 (0.2\\%) & 1 (0.1\\%)\\\\\n\\addlinespace[0.3em]\n\\multicolumn{4}{l}{\\textbf{Have you ever served in the Armed Forces?}}\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Yes & 53 (8.5\\%) & 68 (10.6\\%) & 121 (9.6\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}No & 571 (91.5\\%) & 571 (89.4\\%) & 1142 (90.4\\%)\\\\\n\\addlinespace[0.3em]\n\\multicolumn{4}{l}{\\textbf{Are you now serving in the Armed Forces?}}\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Yes & 5 (0.8\\%) & 10 (1.6\\%) & 15 (1.2\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}No & 48 (7.7\\%) & 58 (9.1\\%) & 106 (8.4\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Missing & 571 (91.5\\%) & 571 (89.4\\%) & 1142 (90.4\\%)\\\\\n\\addlinespace[0.3em]\n\\multicolumn{4}{l}{\\textbf{Member of immediate family served or is currently serving}}\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}Yes & 215 (34.5\\%) & 223 (34.9\\%) & 438 (34.7\\%)\\\\\n\\hspace{1em}No & 409 (65.5\\%) & 416 (65.1\\%) & 825 (65.3\\%)\\\\\n\\addlinespace[0.3em]\n\\multicolumn{4}{l}{\\textbf{Q66.
